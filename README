BERLIN CLOCK KATA

The Berlin Clock uses twenty-four lights to tell time. A blinking lamp on top
represents seconds (off for odd, on for even). The first row has four lights
representing five hours each. The second row has four lights representing one
hour each. The third row has eleven lights representing five minutes each. The
fourth row has four lights representing one minute each. The objective of this
kata is to convert digital times to binary strings representing the clock's
lights (0 for off, 1 for on).
